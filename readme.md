WIP - photos soon :)!


This is an edited Allium58 with my GitHub printed on the silk screen. All credits go to beekeeb. Have a good day :)

I did this using this [element14](https://community.element14.com/members-area/b/blog/posts/kicad-6---adding-logos-and-graphics-to-a-silkscreen) article.

Please find the original repo for more details.
