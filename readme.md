This is an edited Allium58 with my GitHub printed on the silk screen. All credits go to beekeeb.

I used this [element14](https://community.element14.com/members-area/b/blog/posts/kicad-6---adding-logos-and-graphics-to-a-silkscreen) article to do this.


Please find the original repo for further details.

Have a good day :)
